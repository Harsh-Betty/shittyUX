            <p>
              Congratulations! You've reached the end of this horizontal
              odyssey. You've scrolled, you've filled out forms, you've clicked
              buttons that definitely weren't what they seemed. You've
              experienced something truly special.
            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, there's more. See that burger icon in the navigation?
              Yeah, the actual hamburger picture. Click it three times. First
              click does nothing. Second click downloads a pickle. Third click
              opens the menu. Then you can access Chaos Mode.
            </p>
            <p class="justified-text">
              Why three clicks? Why a pickle? Why any of this? These are
              excellent questions. Questions that we're not going to answer
              because honestly, where's the fun in that? Sometimes things just
              are the way they are.

              We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. A full
              commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any
              other guy.
            </p>
            <p class="justified-text">
              I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand.
              Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run
              around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say
              goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've known each other for so long. Your heart's been aching but
              you're too shy to say it. Inside we both know what's been going on.
              We know the game and we're gonna play it. And if you ask me how
              I'm feeling. Don't tell me you're too blind to see.
