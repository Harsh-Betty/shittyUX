              cool. We've been expecting you, sort of. Not really, but now that

              here to do. Eventually. We promise it's all possible, just...
              well, you'll see.

              But wait, there's more. See that burger icon in the navigation?
              Yeah, the actual hamburger picture. Click it three times. First
              click does nothing. Second click downloads a pickle. Third click
              opens the menu. Then you can access Chaos Mode.

            <p class="justified-text">
              Why three clicks? Why a pickle? Why any of this? These are
              excellent questions. Questions that we're not going to answer

              are the way they are.
